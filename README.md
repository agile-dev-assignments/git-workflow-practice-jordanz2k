[Why JavaScript is Hard to Learn](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/why-is-javascript-so-hard-to-learn/)

#### Why I like this article

I like this article because simply put, JS has been a difficult concept to grasp for me because everything it is counterintuitive and goes against many rules I learned in my days picking up C, C++, and even Java. First of all, the typing on JavaScript is different (C is static type vs dynamic on JS). Then there are the logic errors that are usually caught in C/Java but JS lets it run and you couldn't figure it out for the light of day.

There are many things to complain about JS, but hopefully through this class I will get better at it!

It's interesting to read about all the layers of difficulty that come with learning JavaScript. Before I started learning JavaScript, a friend told me it was difficult. Personally, I didn't struggle too much with the syntax, so I was a bit confused about what was so hard about it. However, I soon learned that even though I understood the syntax, there is a lot more to learn if I plan to make anything useful out of JavaScript. This article highlighted a lot of these difficulties, and while it is a bit overwhelming, it is certainly better to be prepared.
